<h2>Add Customer</h2>

<p>With the customer's permission, a picture is taken with the device camera.</p>
<p>This will allow the application to 'learn' who the user is</p>

<p>Here is the image captured.  When <b>Add</b> is clicked the image will be uploaded to a database and used for comparison
  the next time the customer tries to login.

<button ng-click="add()" class="btn btn-primary" value="Add"/>
